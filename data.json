Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you\nOh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere, and the sound of children's laughter fills the air\nAnd everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing\nSanta, won't you bring me the one I really need? Won't you please bring my baby to me?\nOh, I don't want a lot for Christmas, this is all I'm asking for\nI just wanna see my baby, standing right outside my door\nOh, I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know\nMake my wish come true, Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you\nYou, baby\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby",
